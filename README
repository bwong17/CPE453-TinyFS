1.) Our program works pretty well with the testing we have done.  We are not sure how
you are planning on testing it, but we are confident than it will not seg fault
with whatever tests you plan on giving it.  It will however return error codes
as integers which will in turn cause other functions to fail and return error codes
but it should make it to the end of the script.  The error codes can be found in
TinyFS_errno.h.  Our Demo program demonstrates all the various functionality of the program
and should be read almost as a narrative as the program is run.

2.) The additional functionality is listed below and can be seen in our Demo program
mixed in with the required functionality.  Please give the demo program a read as we 
believe we have all the evidence there that the program is functional including the additional
features.

The additional features we included are :
 a. display fragments
 b. directory listing and renaming
 d. read-only and writeByte support
 e. timestamps

3.) We managed to solve all of the bugs we could think of during the testing phase
of the program.  We believe we accounted for most of the possible test cases in
our demo program.  Once again please give it an actual read to follow our logic
and proof of this.
